# MediaMop

## A note on this project

This is a vibe coded project. I don't know how to code and I have nothing but respect for the people who do.

I needed something that fit my exact requirements and couldn't find anything out in the wild that did what I wanted, so I built it — with a lot of help from AI.

Every feature exists because I needed it.
Every decision was made because it made sense to me as a user first.

If it's useful to you, feel free to use it.
I'm not forcing it on anyone and I'm not hiding behind anything.

Take it, fork it, do whatever you want with it.

— Built by someone who just wanted their media library to work properly.

MediaMop is a standalone product: **FastAPI + SQLite** backend (`apps/backend`) and **React + Vite** web shell (`apps/web`). This repository is **not** the Fetcher app; Fetcher remains a separate codebase.

## Quick start

**Prerequisites:** **Python 3.11+**, **Node.js LTS** (npm on `PATH`). The app uses **file-backed SQLite** under **`MEDIAMOP_HOME`** (see **`apps/backend/.env.example`**). Open a **new** PowerShell window after installing Node so `npm` resolves.

From the **repository root**, in order:

1. **Backend Python env (one-time)** — `cd apps/backend` → `py -3 -m venv .venv` → `.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1` → `pip install -e .`
2. **Backend `.env` (one-time)** — `copy .env.example .env` in `apps/backend`, then set **`MEDIAMOP_SESSION_SECRET`**. Optionally set **`MEDIAMOP_HOME`** or **`MEDIAMOP_DB_PATH`**. The API and Alembic **load `apps/backend/.env` automatically**; shell env vars still override.
3. **Migrations** — From repo root: **`.\scripts\dev-migrate.ps1`**, or manually `alembic upgrade head` from `apps/backend` with **`PYTHONPATH=src`**.
4. **API** — From repo root: **`.\scripts\dev-backend.ps1`**. Confirm **`GET /health`** on the API port (**`scripts/dev-ports.json`**) returns **200** — that is **liveness only**. **`/api/v1`** needs **`MEDIAMOP_SESSION_SECRET`**, migrations applied, and a writable database path.
5. **Web** — Second terminal: **`.\scripts\dev-web.ps1`**. Open **`http://127.0.0.1:8782`**. Leave **`VITE_API_BASE_URL`** unset for the Vite **`/api`** proxy.

**Optional:** **`.\scripts\dev.ps1`** opens API + web in two windows (launcher only; run `.env` + **`.\scripts\dev-migrate.ps1`** first). **`.\scripts\verify-local.ps1`** runs unit tests, then (unless **`-SkipLiveChecks`**) checks env, DB + Alembic head, live **`/health`** and **`/api/v1/auth/bootstrap/status`**, and **static** Vite proxy lines in **`vite.config.ts`** (not a live browser/proxy proof).

Canonical ports: **[`docs/ports.md`](docs/ports.md)**.

Full instructions: **[`docs/local-development.md`](docs/local-development.md)**.

## Product paths

Runtime file layout is anchored by **`MEDIAMOP_HOME`** (optional). Defaults are OS-appropriate (`%LOCALAPPDATA%\MediaMop` on Windows, XDG data dir on Linux/macOS). It must **not** default to “whatever Git clone directory you’re in.” Details in [`docs/local-development.md`](docs/local-development.md).

## Architecture

Locked decisions live under [`docs/adr/`](docs/adr/).

## Transitional Jinja app

An older Jinja/SQLite experiment lived in another repository; it is **not** part of this tree and is **not** the active shell. **`apps/web`** is the visual source of truth for the product UI.
