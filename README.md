# MediaMop

<!-- README_LOCKED_SECTION_START: project-note -->
## A note on this project

This is a vibe coded project. I don't know how to code and I have nothing but respect for the people who do.

I needed something that fit my exact requirements and couldn't find anything out in the wild that did what I wanted, so I built it — with a lot of help from AI.

Every feature exists because I needed it.
Every decision was made because it made sense to me as a user first.

If it's useful to you, feel free to use it.
I'm not forcing it on anyone and I'm not hiding behind anything.

Take it, fork it, do whatever you want with it.

— Built by someone who just wanted their media library to work properly.

MediaMop is a standalone product: **FastAPI + SQLite** backend (`apps/backend`) and **React + Vite** web shell (`apps/web`). This repo is **not** the legacy standalone “Fetcher” deployment or Docker stack from earlier iterations; it **does** ship an in-repo **Fetcher module** (`mediamop.modules.fetcher` plus the Fetcher pages in `apps/web`) for Radarr/Sonarr background work.

## Quick start

**Prerequisites:** **Python 3.11+**, **Node.js LTS** (npm on `PATH`). The app uses **file-backed SQLite** under **`MEDIAMOP_HOME`** (see **`apps/backend/.env.example`**). Open a **new** PowerShell window after installing Node so `npm` resolves.

From the **repository root**, in order:

1. **Backend Python env (one-time)** — `cd apps/backend` → `py -3 -m venv .venv` → `.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1` → `pip install -e .`
2. **Backend `.env` (one-time)** — `copy .env.example .env` in `apps/backend`, then set **`MEDIAMOP_SESSION_SECRET`**. Optionally set **`MEDIAMOP_HOME`** or **`MEDIAMOP_DB_PATH`**. The API and Alembic **load `apps/backend/.env` automatically**; shell env vars still override.
3. **Migrations** — From repo root: **`.\scripts\dev-migrate.ps1`**, or manually `alembic upgrade head` from `apps/backend` with **`PYTHONPATH=src`**.
4. **Run API + web together (recommended)** — `cd apps/web` → `npm ci` → **`npm run dev`**. That command **stops anything still listening on the default dev API and Vite ports**, then starts this repo’s API and Vite in one terminal and waits until **`/health`** is up before opening the UI. Use the URLs printed in the log (**`http://127.0.0.1:8782`** / **`http://localhost:8782`** — both work in **`MEDIAMOP_ENV=development`** thanks to paired loopback origins on the backend). Leave **`VITE_API_BASE_URL`** unset so the browser uses the Vite **`/api`** proxy (same origin as the page; cookies work).

**Split terminals (optional):** **`.\scripts\dev-backend.ps1`** and **`.\scripts\dev-web.ps1`** from repo root, or **`.\scripts\dev.ps1`** to open them in new windows. **`npm run dev:quick`** in `apps/web` skips the port-stop step (only when you know the default ports are already free).

**Installing “for real” (end users):** This repo is **source** for developers. A shipped product (installer, container, or hosted deployment) should expose **one** canonical HTTPS web origin and set **`MEDIAMOP_CORS_ORIGINS`** / **`MEDIAMOP_TRUSTED_BROWSER_ORIGINS`** on the API to that origin (and **`MEDIAMOP_ENV=production`**). Operators do not juggle `localhost` vs `127.0.0.1` there — that confusion is specific to local dev.

**Optional:** **`.\scripts\verify-local.ps1`** runs unit tests, then (unless **`-SkipLiveChecks`**) checks env, DB + Alembic head, live **`/health`** and **`/api/v1/auth/bootstrap/status`**, and **static** Vite proxy lines in **`vite.config.ts`** (not a live browser/proxy proof).

Canonical ports: **[`docs/ports.md`](docs/ports.md)**.

Full instructions: **[`docs/local-development.md`](docs/local-development.md)**.

**Docker (alpha testers):** **`docker pull ghcr.io/jampat000/mediamop:alpha`** then **`docker run …`** (no clone needed) — or clone the repo and use **`docker compose --env-file .env.mediamop pull`** / **`up -d`** from the root that contains **`compose.yaml`**. Full steps and troubleshooting — **[`docker/README.md`](docker/README.md)**.

## Product paths

Runtime file layout is anchored by **`MEDIAMOP_HOME`** (optional). Defaults are OS-appropriate (`%LOCALAPPDATA%\MediaMop` on Windows, XDG data dir on Linux/macOS). It must **not** default to “whatever Git clone directory you’re in.” Details in [`docs/local-development.md`](docs/local-development.md).

## Architecture

Locked decisions live under [`docs/adr/`](docs/adr/). Repo-local shipped vs next work: [`docs/TASKS.md`](docs/TASKS.md).

## Transitional Jinja app

An older Jinja/SQLite experiment lived in another repository; it is **not** part of this tree and is **not** the active shell. **`apps/web`** is the visual source of truth for the product UI.
