# Architecture Decision Records — MediaMop

ADRs in this folder capture **locked** structural and platform choices for this repository. They override ad hoc experimentation when the two conflict.

**Durable-job timing:** operator-controlled intervals, schedules, cooldowns, retries, last-run, and timing-based pruning must follow [ADR-0009](ADR-0009-suite-wide-timing-isolation.md) (per module, then per job family).

**Numbering:** [ADR-0004](ADR-0004-reserved-number.md), [ADR-0005](ADR-0005-reserved-number.md), and [ADR-0006](ADR-0006-reserved-number.md) are intentionally reserved (no architectural body) so filenames and cross-references stay stable. **Git rename noise** around historical durable-job table migrations is documented in [note-git-rename-metadata-93547e2.md](note-git-rename-metadata-93547e2.md); fixing it would require history rewrite and force-push.
