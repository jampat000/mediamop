# ADR-0009: Suite-wide timing isolation for durable work

## Status

Accepted — **hard rule** for Refiner, Pruner, Subber, and any future module-owned durable-job lanes.

## Context

Operators configure **when** and **how often** background work may run: intervals, schedule windows, cooldowns, retries, and visibility into last completion. If two unrelated job families share one timer, one cooldown bucket, or one pruning rule driven by the other family’s delay, one lane **blocks or suppresses** the other. That violates the operator contract.

Module-owned tables and workers (ADR-0007) are necessary but not sufficient: **timing contracts must also be owned** at module boundary first, then **per scheduled job family** inside the module.

## Decision

### Standard (non-negotiable)

1. **Separate by module first.** No timing contract defined for module A may be stored, read, or advanced on behalf of module B. No shared row, column, env var, or in-memory timer substitutes for that split (except purely **process-internal** mechanics listed under “Out of scope” below).

2. **Separate by job family inside the module.** Any distinct user-facing durable job family (distinct `job_kind` contract or distinct product “lane”) has **its own** timing surface: its own interval and/or schedule window, its own retry/cooldown semantics, its own last-run persistence (when last-run is a product signal), and its own pruning window when pruning is derived from retry/cooldown minutes.

3. **No hidden global timing** that causes one job family to wait on another’s eligibility. Cooldown keys, schedule checks, and persisted “last run” fields must not collapse multiple families into one bucket.

### What counts as a timing contract

These require per-family (and per-module) isolation when operators set expectations:

- **Interval** between enqueue ticks or between worker-driven passes tied to a family.
- **Schedule window** (wall-clock / timezone gate before work runs).
- **Cooldown** between repeated actions on the same logical item for that family.
- **Retry delay** (minimum time before re-attempting the same item or pass for that family).
- **Last-run tracking** when persisted for operator or automation summaries **per family**.
- **Pruning** of durable audit or cooldown rows when the cutoff is computed from another family’s delay (forbidden: one family’s delay must not set the prune horizon for another family’s rows).

### Worker count and leases

- **`MEDIAMOP_REFINER_WORKER_COUNT`**, **`MEDIAMOP_PRUNER_WORKER_COUNT`**, and **`MEDIAMOP_SUBBER_WORKER_COUNT`** control **throughput and claim ordering** on their respective lanes. They do **not** replace per-family intervals, cooldowns, or schedules. Increasing worker count must not be the only knob that “fixes” one family waiting on another.

### Process-internal mechanics (out of scope for “shared contracts”)

Fixed short backoffs after **enqueue I/O errors**, worker **idle sleep** between claim attempts, and **lease TTL** on claimed rows are infrastructure stability knobs. They are **not** operator-configured timing contracts and may remain global **within that worker pool**. They must **not** implement product cooldown or replace per-family schedule logic.

### Examples (*arr* automatic search lanes)

When automatic missing/upgrade search was backed by a dedicated durable-job lane, these were **four** independent timing contracts (per-app × per-lane), each with its own settings row, last-run column, enqueue interval, and schedule window fields. At head, the same **logical** independence is preserved in **`arr_library_operator_settings`** and related activity/state — not by sharing one timer across lanes.

**Failed-import** cleanup drives: Radarr vs Sonarr use **separate** schedule interval settings and **separate** dedupe keys / job kinds — independent contracts.

### Refiner (shipped durable families)

Refiner owns ``refiner_jobs`` and in-process Refiner workers. **Each** durable ``refiner.*`` family that exposes operator-controlled timing must keep that timing on **family-local** settings and tasks (no cross-family coupling on the Refiner lane).

Shipped today:

- **`refiner.supplied_payload_evaluation.v1`** — optional periodic enqueue via ``MEDIAMOP_REFINER_SUPPLIED_PAYLOAD_EVALUATION_SCHEDULE_*`` (legacy ``MEDIAMOP_REFINER_LIBRARY_AUDIT_PASS_SCHEDULE_*`` still read when the new keys are absent) and ``refiner_supplied_payload_evaluation_schedule_enabled`` / ``refiner_supplied_payload_evaluation_schedule_interval_seconds`` on ``MediaMopSettings``; failure backoff is local to that enqueue module (process-internal per ADR-0009 “Out of scope”).
- **`refiner.candidate_gate.v1`** — manual enqueue only in this product pass; **no** shared schedule/cooldown/last-run row with other Refiner families.
- **`refiner.file.remux_pass.v1`** — manual enqueue only: per-file ffprobe + remux plan (+ optional ffmpeg when ``dry_run`` is false); **no** periodic schedule or shared timing row with other Refiner families. Activity rows carry a structured JSON ``detail`` (outcome, inspected path, plan summary, before/after track lines, ffmpeg argv preview) rendered readably on the Activity page for that event type only.
- **`refiner.watched_folder.remux_scan_dispatch.v1`** — operator POST manual enqueue **and** optional Refiner-only periodic enqueue via ``MEDIAMOP_REFINER_WATCHED_FOLDER_REMUX_SCAN_DISPATCH_SCHEDULE_*`` plus separate ``PERIODIC_ENQUEUE_REMUX_JOBS`` / ``PERIODIC_REMUX_DRY_RUN`` flags on ``MediaMopSettings`` (not shared with supplied payload evaluation timing). Each run walks the saved watched folder, applies the same ownership/upstream blocking truth as the candidate gate, optionally enqueues remux rows, and writes one activity summary (``scan_trigger``: ``manual`` vs ``periodic``). Periodic tick skips enqueue when a scan job is already ``pending`` or ``leased``.

### Pruner (Phase 1)

- **Lane only** — ``pruner_jobs`` and in-process workers; **no** shipped durable ``pruner.*`` families or operator schedules in this pass. Future removal job families must each carry **family-local** timing per this ADR (and per ``docs/pruner-forward-design-constraints.md`` for TV/Movies and per server-instance splits).

### Subber (Subber v1)

- **Lane only** — ``subber_jobs`` and in-process workers; **TV vs Movies** use separate job kinds and separate ``subber_subtitle_state`` rows (never cross-updating scopes).
- **Webhook + manual search** — immediate ``subber.subtitle_search.*.v1`` jobs; no shared timing with other modules.
- **Library scan schedule** — optional periodic enqueue reads ``subber_settings`` (per-scope enable, interval, and optional wall-clock window) plus ``MEDIAMOP_SUBBER_LIBRARY_SCAN_SCHEDULE_*`` on ``MediaMopSettings`` for the asyncio tick cadence only — not shared with Refiner/Pruner schedules.

Pruner and Subber packages point to ADR-0007 for lane ownership; **this ADR** is the timing addendum for scheduled/cooled families.

### Compliance notes (audit snapshot)

| Area | Isolated? | Why |
|------|-----------|-----|
| Failed-import Radarr vs Sonarr | Yes | Separate `MEDIAMOP_FAILED_IMPORT_*` intervals, separate periodic tasks, separate dedupe keys. |
| *arr* automatic search four lanes | Yes | Per-lane fields on `arr_library_operator_settings` (and historical per-lane state where applicable), independent schedules and last-run semantics per lane. |
| Refiner durable families (supplied payload evaluation, candidate gate, file remux pass, watched-folder remux scan dispatch) | Yes | Separate job kinds, handlers, and enqueue paths; supplied payload evaluation has its own optional schedule env + interval only for that family; watched-folder remux scan dispatch has its **own** optional schedule env + interval (and periodic remux flags), independent of supplied payload evaluation; candidate gate and file remux pass remain manual POST enqueue only. No shared last-run or cooldown row across those families. |
| Pruner lane (Phase 1) | Yes (no product families yet) | Queue/worker infrastructure only; no periodic Pruner tasks. |
| Subber durable families (cue timeline constraint check) | Yes (manual-only) | Single shipped family; operator POST enqueue only — no Subber periodic task shares timing state with other modules. |

### Soft spot (configuration, not runtime coupling)

If an operator leaves lane-specific env unset, **legacy fallback env** may populate two Sonarr (or two Radarr) lanes with the **same numeric default** from one shared legacy variable. That is **defaults only**; cooldown **state** and last-run **columns** remain per lane. Prefer setting lane-specific env for independent contracts.

## Consequences

- New features undergo review against this ADR when they touch schedules, cooldowns, or retries.
- Tests that lock per-lane behavior (e.g. *arr* search cooldown keys where applicable) are expected to grow with new families.
