"""Refiner worker bounds — shared by :mod:`mediamop.core.config` without import cycles.

Rollout semantics (Pass 21):

- **0** — In-process Refiner asyncio workers disabled (tests, controlled runtime).
- **1** — Supported default for SQLite-first deployments (single writer; predictable).
- **2..8** — Guarded capability only: claim SQL is atomic, but SQLite remains one writer;
  multi-worker is **not** the normal production posture until ops validate under load.
