"""API composition — versioned JSON product surface.

Convention (locked in Phase 3):

- **Operational health**: ``GET /health`` at the **application root** (probe-friendly, no version prefix).
- **Product JSON API**: all future browser- and integration-facing JSON routes under **``/api/v1``**
  (mounted via :func:`build_v1_router`). Do not add unversioned product paths at root.

Module routers (fetcher/refiner/etc.) will be included under ``/api/v1`` in later phases — not in the nested ``mediamop/`` Jinja app.
